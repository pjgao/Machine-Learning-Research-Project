Machine Learning for Storage System Reliability Prediction
This is the summer research I did in the summer holiday of 2018. In this research project, I have mainly tried to reproduced 3 papers:

1.Prediction Disk Replacement towards Reliable Data Centers (KDD16)

2.Hard Drive Failure Prediction Using Classification and Regression Trees (DSN14)

3.Improving Service Availability of Cloud Systems by Prediction Disk Error (ATC18)
The source paper can be found in each folder respectively.
